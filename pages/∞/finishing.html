<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>Often I&#39;d like to start a new project, but shaving-the-yak quickly kicks in, and I start doing things like:</p>

<h1>Writing all the software from scratch</h1>

<p>I&#39;d like to start a web comic, but it has to be self-hosted, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m an indie-webber</li>
<li>I don&#39;t want to pay for a hosted solution</li>
<li>Something exists, but it doesn&#39;t have quite all the features I want</li>
</ul>

<p>I then also think things like <em>&quot;Ah, this is the opportune moment to learn language X, so I&#39;ll start re-inventing Wheel badly in that&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>Nothing ends up getting done, because <em>Wheel</em> takes the back-seat after a while, especially when that Other creative impulse comes creeping back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put the pen down. Look for that hosted solution. Do an MVP. Remember that you wanted to release a web comic, not web comic software.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>I learn something on the job</h1>

<p>...but have to write a blog post about the thing I learnt first. Like this post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s good to make a note of those moments of clarity, but do it quickly and move on quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>My creative rhythm isn&#39;t compatible with the life I chose</h1>

<p>You do your best work when</p>

<ul>
<li>the sun is down</li>
<li>it is 5AM</li>
<li>you&#39;ve had the opportunity to wake up slowly over the course of 2 hours, and is finally in the zone</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, you can&#39;t anymore.</p>

<p>If you go to bed too late, you&#39;ll have to wake up with the family early the next morning anyway. Children need feeding and getting dressed, and you can&#39;t be a groggy arse around them.</p>

<p>Creating things in the evening might encroach on you and your spouse&#39;s together-time, because he/she mightn&#39;t have the same rhythm as you do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either learn to force yourself to work on someone else&#39;s schedule, or choose a life which suits you.</p>
