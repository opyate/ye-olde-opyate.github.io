<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>I recently got into <a href="http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/">Riak</a>, and subsequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">Consistent Hashing</a>, and found the referenced <a href="http://www.lexemetech.com/2007/11/consistent-hashing.html">Java implementation</a> quite a delightful and informative read.</p>

<p>As any hacker would, I thought I’d implement it in my current favourite language: Scala. Half-way through I realised that Scala’s TreeMap is as slow as a geriatric slug on a salted snowed-in street. So, I did the <code>import java.util.{TreeMap =&gt; JTreeMap}</code> thing and got cracking:</p>

<p>The gist can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/1927001">https://gist.github.com/1927001</a></p>

<h1>How many virtual nodes?</h1>

<p>Systems using consistent hashing needs the “virtual nodes” parameter tuned so as to find a sweet spot where you get good mixing of cached objects amongst nodes (i.e. all nodes store a somewhat equal amount of stuff).</p>

<p>The gist above, when run, will generate a file called “dat” in the current directory, which can be fed into <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">gnuplot</a> to show the standard deviation (as a percentage of the mean) for certain sizes of vnode.</p>

<p>As per the lexemetech.com article, a value not higher than 5% or 10% is preferable, and for 10 nodes, this amounts to about 100 or 200 vnodes. Let’s verify this.</p>

<h1>gnuplot</h1>

<p>Using a terminal, run gnuplot in the same location as “dat”, and you’ll see this prompt: <code>gnuplot&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now, copy/paste this entire bit of code into the terminal:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/opyate/1927001#gnuplot">https://gist.github.com/opyate/1927001#gnuplot</a></p>

<p>Here’s the plot:</p>

<p><img src="http://funkshional.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/plot1.png" alt="The plot"></p>

<p>As you can see, for a large amount of vnodes, the percentage tends to 1%.</p>

<p>You can see this more easily by inputting this into the gnuplot prompt:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/opyate/1927001#gnuplot-amend">https://gist.github.com/opyate/1927001#gnuplot-amend</a></p>

<p>According to my plot, I start to get a low SD around 50 vnodes (5 times my number of nodes), but then this could just be because my hashing function mixes better than the one used by lexemetech.</p>
