<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>Last week I put my Turk to work and started ticking some things off of the to-do list. Some “allowed” distractions set in, since I wanted to see how I felt after a whole weekend away from my startup</p>

<h1>Distractions and doubts</h1>

<h2>Doubt.</h2>

<p>One idle moment was filled scanning the Marketing section at Foyles. All this new information is daunting, and can be demotivating. In keeping with the <strong>“Learn things relevant to your venture, where it matters”</strong> from Day #1, I wondered if it was really necessary to become the next <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294">Seth Godin</a> overnight.</p>

<p>The answer is No. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20</a> came to mind: do (or, in my case, learn) the 20% that delivers 80% effect. On the other hand, if I was to sell a product geared toward marketers, it would be a whole different ballgame.</p>

<h2>Distraction.</h2>

<p>Chapter 2 of Rob’s book discusses niches. Finding your niche is the first step. I already had an idea which the Turk was validating for me, but I took the chapter onboard. Niche ideas are really cheap and in abundance, and it would be dead easy to start a business every week for the next few months.</p>

<p>I’m easily distracted, and a good idea can occupy my brain for hours, but I run the risk of doing either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Confuse matters.</strong> Solve a problem and solve it simply, but solve it well: Coat hangers was a good idea, and so was Monopoly™. Monopoly™-themed coat hangers? A hanger for your game once you’re done playing? I don’t think so. Developers: Don’t add any unnecessary features just because it’s cool.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://funkshional.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/hamster.jpg" width="50%" align="right" alt="Hamsters are fragile. Trust me; I know."></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doing something you’re not an expert at.</strong> OK, so “hamster burial kits”, right? Genius! Every kid has a hamster, and all hamsters eventually… have accidents. You can get little <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/337771124/willow_urn.html">willow urns in bulk from Alibaba</a>, bundle it with a softly worded eulogy and even throw in a little bio-degradable gravestone. Actually, I’m supposed to play devil’s advocate on this one and say something like “but, I’m no hamster expert”. I can’t. This idea reigns supreme.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doubts and distractions, to mention only a few. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=business+bootstrapper">Serial bootstrappers</a> everywhere says it gets easier: “Just keep at it. Fail fast, learn the lesson, and recover quickly”. I have my goals on a poster on my wall. Also some small inspirational tidbits. And you know what? This <em>IS</em> actually fun :-)</p>

<h1>What did the Turk say?</h1>

<p>It turns out my idea is not a good one. So says a small sample of my fellow Brits and our friends from across the pond. Surprisingly, my idea was also <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:E7Nu7fWgTwwJ:www.shallwemeetup.com/+http://www.shallwemeetup.com/&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">implemented</a> by a handful of hackers at a “Startup Weekend” in The Valley a few months ago.</p>

<p>However, their site is down and I can only guess that <strong>they put product before market</strong> – a no-no in the startup world. Besides, I think “geo” and “social” has been done, and the market is too big and competitive. I established early on that I want this venture to be small and self-funded, and whipping up the next FourSquare is not the way forward.</p>

<h1>Now what?</h1>

<p>I repeat the cycle: find a niche, test the market, etc. I’ve also decided that I’d rather sell <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">hosted software</a> than a physical product. With “hamster burial kits”, you need to deal with returns; you need to buy stock; you need to compile the bundles and dispatch it.</p>

<p>Centrally hosted software can easily be upgraded and fixed. If a feature is troublesome, just remove it. More importantly: software is my forté. And after years of writing it, I know when a software product is “good enough”.</p>
