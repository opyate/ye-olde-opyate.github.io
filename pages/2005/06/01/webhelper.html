<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>Some intranet applications (and some unintuitive web applications) can be confusing at times regarding navigation and how to get a task done. Training can be expensive.</p>

<p>WebHelper is a tool with which you can pre-record mouse movements, clicks, and the related help-text.</p>

<p>Imagine going to a page with a workflow you&#39;re unfamiliar with. You click the WebHelper icon in the corner, and the page comes to life: a white section appears at the bottom or top of the page, and it populates with text as the cursor takes on a life on it&#39;s own and shows you where the first button is which you have to press. Or something like that. It&#39;s kinda like that utility with which you can create an AVI movie of a session. In this case it will be Javascript-based, and no costly and time-consuming movie downloads.</p>
