<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p><img src="http://distilleryimage6.ak.instagram.com/267f6626581311e3986c12b308e0cf9c_8.jpg" width="50%" align="right"> I&#39;ve recently applied to <a href="http://www.toptal.com/?ref=14568">Toptal</a> and sucked miserably at the entry exam. My algo chops were blunt and I thought I&#39;d rectify it by revisiting <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. With the startup last year and the baby this year I just haven&#39;t been able to find the time for programming challenges, but that has to change.</p>

<p>Looking at my Project Euler source directory, I saw that I left it at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=17">problem 17</a>, so next up will be <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=18">18</a>. The problem description, however, mentions that the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=67">problem repeats itselt as 67</a>, but with a bigger input that will run 20 billion years if you go the brute force route.</p>

<p>I worked a little on this problem last night, and decided to by-pass the brute force solution completely. It was a bit late, though, and I pulled my eyelids open far enough to make it to bed. I then went on to dream about the damn problem all night. I knew there had to be a simple bottom-up fold-based solution, and the <em>voila</em> moment came for me when I realised I had to seed the fold computation with the base layer in the triangle.</p>

<p>Here you go:</p>

<h1>A little explanation</h1>

<p>The triangle is represented as a nested list, like so: <strong>List(List(1), List(2, 3), List(4, 5, 6))</strong> and so forth.</p>

<pre>

     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \ / \
 4   5   6    <- this is the "base layer" in my explanation.
</pre>

<p>Since you need to add the maximum of the two immediate children to the layer above, a foldRight wouldn&#39;t give me all the info I need in the curent iteration. Foldright for me means &quot;the data is coming FROM the right&quot;, i.e. <strong>List(4, 5, 6)</strong> will be processed first, then <strong>List(2, 3)</strong> but at no point in the iteration will they be available together so I can do the sum. <strong>List(4, 5, 6)</strong> would need to come into the iteration with <strong>List(2, 3)</strong> in another way, and I realised I can use the foldRight&#39;s accumulator for that by seeding the foldRight with the base layer in the triangle (aka the last list <strong>List(4, 5, 6)</strong>).</p>

<p>The easiest way was to just seed the foldRight with a list of zeros one element larger than the base layer. You then break it up into pairs using <strong>sliding(2,1)</strong>, take the max of the pairs, and sum the max with the corresponding (thanks to <strong>zip</strong>) element in the layer above.</p>

<pre>

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4   5   6
 / \ / \ / \
0   0   0   0    <- this becomes the new "base layer", or "seed"
</pre>

<p>No mutable state; no recursion; simple to understand. As <a href="http://www.applied-duality.com">Erik Meijer</a> would say: &quot;baby code&quot;.</p>
