<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>There are a lot of <a href="http://typesafe.com/activator/templates">new examples</a> up on the Typesafe website, a few with the word &quot;Reactive&quot; in them to drive home the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">credo</a> behind the framework. One of my favourite examples, however, seem to have been demoted but still remains one of my favourites: <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/webwords">webwords</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://webwords.herokuapp.com/">The old Heroku link</a> to the live running instance of webwords does not seem to be up anymore, so I whipped up a quick Chef cookbook with which to spin up your own local instance.</p>

<p>You can find the Github repo <a href="https://github.com/opyate/webwords-vm.git">here</a>. Spin it up and have fun.</p>

<p><em>BTW, join us in doing the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Principles of Reactive Programming course</a></em></p>

The original blog post was going to be a guide to getting webwords cookbook working the old fashioned way, but then I discovered Berkshelf and thought it all a bit pointless.

~/C/s/webwords-vm ❯❯❯ du -chs /home/opyate/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@vagrant
147M    /home/opyate/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@vagrant
147M    total

Remove these two lines from the newly-generated Vagrantfile:

  config.ssh.max_tries = 40
  config.ssh.timeout   = 120 

These switches have been deprecated.

# Chef server

git clone https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server.git
cd chef-server
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant up

Et voila! Now you have a Chef server.

After logging into the Chef server, it shows the following message, which in turn shows a few things I'll definitely check out and bog about at another time, e.g. Juju and Landscape.

<code>
~/V/chef-server git:master ❯❯❯ vagrant ssh                                                                                                                                                                         ✱

</code>

You can see your server at https://33.33.33.50 in your web browser to get started. (the sidebar says to log in with 'admin' and 'p@ssw0rd1', in case you missed it).

# Client

Now, turn your workstation into a chef client.

Firstly, we need knife. Since I rarely muddy my *entire* system with Ruby packages, I localise stuff to gemsets:

rvm use 2.0.0-p247@chef-client --create --default
sudo apt-get install ruby-bundler

I then use the following Gemfile, and run 'bundle install' on it:

<todo the gemfile>

See ~/VMs/chef-client
</todo>


I re-iterate the important steps from the [official documentation](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/03/11/chef-11-server-up-and-running/):
(please match my steps with the steps on the above blog since I don't provide as much detail)

* copy chef-validator.pem from the chef server to ~/.chef (create the latter if it doesn't exist)

On the chef server, do:

<code>
vagrant@chef-server:~$ sudo cp /etc/chef-server/chef-validator.pem /vagrant/
vagrant@chef-server:~$ sudo cp /etc/chef-server/admin.pem /vagrant/
</code>

Then back in the cloned directory (the directory containing Vagrantfile):

<code>
mv admin.pem chef-validator.pem ~/.chef  
</code>

Add the following to the /etc/hosts:

33.33.33.50 chef-server

In the same folder where we installed the Chef gem, run:

knife configure -i

Output should look like the following:

<pre>
~/V/chef-client ❯❯❯ knife configure -i
WARNING: No knife configuration file found
Where should I put the config file? [/home/opyate/.chef/knife.rb] 
Please enter the chef server URL: [https://annabelle:443] https://chef-server:443
Please enter a name for the new user: [opyate] 
Please enter the existing admin name: [admin] 
Please enter the location of the existing admin's private key: [/etc/chef-server/admin.pem] ~/.chef/admin.pem
Please enter the validation clientname: [chef-validator]

Please enter a password for the new user: 
Created user[opyate]
Configuration file written to /home/opyate/.chef/knife.rb
~/V/chef-client ❯❯❯ 

</pre>

For simplicity, I keep my roles and cookbooks in ~/.chef, so I add the following lines to ~/.chef/knife.rb

<code>

current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/cookbooks"]
role_path                ["#{current_dir}/roles"]
</code>

I create my first cookbook with:

knife  cookbook create gulp -C "Juan Uys" -m "opyate@gmail.com" -I mit -r md

(gulp = Gullible Unnatural Language Processor)

knife cookbook role create gulp

...and then add to run_list: "recipe[gulp]"

We'll add our own custom Java recipe which will use different defaults, e.g. version 7 instead of 6.

<todo include Java7 recipe here>

Also, instead of downloading Java7's dependencies (i.e. java and apt), Berkshelf now kicks in and manages the cookbook dependencies for us.
