It got me thinking about the stuff around the programming languages I use, and my professional skillset in general.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll briefly touch on how a few major events in my life forced me to cut the fat and become more focused.</p>

<p>A few notes, then.</p>

<h1>The programming languages</h1>

<h2>Scala</h2>

<p>My new, old favourite. My go-to language since 2009. I can&#39;t add much for 2013 apart from that I&#39;m happy to see the community mature around it. We&#39;ve gone from &quot;How we adopted Scala at company X&quot; to &quot;How to go back in time using Akka, Play! and XYZ&quot;. Oh, and then the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">reactive course</a> was fun too, and highlighted a few holes in my Akka education.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>

<p>Java still mostly pays the bills, and I&#39;m writing even better Java thanks to Scala. My editor is told to highlight everything in a shade of gray, apart from re-assignables which are red. It all just flows.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pylons</a> and have used Python since 2006-ish for tiny webapps, but this year sees me going down the finance route with <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> thanks to a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis">handful</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata">of</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1">courses</a> I did recently.</p>

<h2>R</h2>

<p>Strangely addictive. I did a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis">data analysis course</a> with the famed Johns Hopkins university earlier this year, and thought I would be &quot;learning&quot; R along the way. If anything, it felt like I already knew R, and the thing that I learned was making a good analysis, writing it perfectly and succintly, and performing an honest peer review. R is perfect for slicing and dicing your data, and it doesn&#39;t get in the way.</p>

<h2>Dart</h2>

<p>The main attraction to Dart for me was the promise of compiling to a better Javascript which you can ever hope to write by hand. The Dart syntax itself is familiar, and then you have the odd goodies like the <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2012/02/method-cascades-in-dart-posted-by-gilad.html">cascade operator</a> (borrowed from Smalltalk) which lets you chain methods without having to return the instance in your API, and being a Scala guy, I love having rockets (=&gt;) scattered all over my code (Dart&#39;s syntactic sugar for concise getters).</p>

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p>Being a backend programmer by trade, I usually don&#39;t go for frontend gigs, but a client this year said they don&#39;t mind me learning on the job, and I&#39;ve heard good things about AngularJS, so I dove right in. I&#39;ve touched on Javascript a lot in the past, but this year I spent a significant tenth of my professional time fiddling with it.</p>

<h2>Haskell</h2>

<p>Yes, I really did spend the tiniest amount of time with Haskell, but enough to mention it here. I downloaded, chopped and changed the XMonad code and the take-away for me was that 2014 will see more Haskell.</p>

<h2>Other languages, not-so-much-languages, and tools</h2>

<p>My starter Dart project is a game (where do I find the time?), hence WebGL and subsequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a>. I&#39;m particularly excited about getting my hands even dirtier with shaders with Mozilla <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/11/live-editing-webgl-shaders-with-firefox-developer-tools/">recently announcing</a> live-editing of shaders using Firefox.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always used Capistrano and Chef for my provisioning and configuration needs, but this year I gave Ansible a shot. I hope Ansible stays the way it is: small, simple, elegant. No agents; just SSH.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>2013 was a bumpy ride. We had a beautiful daughter in June, and I quit my job soon after to freelance from home and be 2 flights of stairs away from her. To be able to learn a few new skills and do 4 courses, I had to make some changes. There are the 5AM starts, the <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout">highly-condensed exercise routine in the morning</a>, diligently deleting anything which doesn&#39;t contribute to the plan I have for our life (this includes articles, emails, etc), and just generally getting things done.</p>

I&#39;ve been in love with doodling since I was a kid, and really took it up this year. I&#39;m an able musician, and since I can code I thought I&#39;d bring these ingredients together and make something nice. (Those umpteen characters and storylines in my head will finally be unleashed!).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far. May you have a great 2014.</p>
