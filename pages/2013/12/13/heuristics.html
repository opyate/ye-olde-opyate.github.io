<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>I recently saw a talk by Jack Dorsey where he iterates a list of commandments for this life, and number three is &quot;drink only lemon water and red wine&quot;.</p>

<p>I love red wine, and was intrigued by this lemon water idea. I investigated and it led me to <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/11-benefits-lemon-water-you-didnt-know-about.html">an article</a> which asks how much lemon water is needed. They quote a heuristic:</p>

<p><em>For those who weigh less than 150 pounds, squeeze half a lemon’s worth of juice into a glass of water. If over 150 pounds, use an entire lemon’s juice.</em></p>

<p>This is a heuristic, and it is beautiful. It saved the author from quoting an entire &quot;weight in pounds to amount of lemon&quot; table.</p>

<p>The heuristic is one of my favourite concepts of all time. During engineering school in the late nineties it became ever more apparent what a powerful concept it is, e.g. using lookup tables when designing flow systems with complex flow dynamics. It makes applied rocket science a bit easier. Or when solving path finding problems where the brute force method is just not a viable option in terms of time complexity.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, I&#39;ve reached my 10 minute limit for writing ★, and since I can&#39;t do this powerful concept any justice with just a few words, I&#39;ll let the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">editors of Wikipedia englighten you</a> further.</p>

<p>★ this is my own heuristic (aka &quot;rule of thumb&quot;) for not spending too much time on writing.</p>
