<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>Let&#39;s make this a quick one. I&#39;m a busy dad, you know.</p>

<p>First of all, nothing come close to the friendship I&#39;ve developed with my wee
little girl this year. She&#39;s two and a half now, and becoming ever more switched
on. She embraced the recent house move admirably. She also has a sneaky sense of
humour, and will make a great fighter one day. (Coming from a civilised man,
this means intellectual fighting, like the ones you encounter in a court room. Naturally.)</p>

<p>Did I mention a new house? Yes, I did. It&#39;s great. Right next to an Ofsted
outstanding (for 20 years running) school. And a park in the back. This means
no-one overlooks us. Which is great. I&#39;m earmarking the garage as a dual study
slash workshop. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>A quick word on tech. I&#39;ve mostly been at Conde Nast this year, heading up the
API team. Our remit is ever expanding, so soon we&#39;ll re-incorporate to something
more &quot;platform team&quot; -like. My immediate team uses JavaScript, but we&#39;ll be
doing more Clojure/ClojureScript soon, and have been getting our hands dirty
with a lot of ops involving Kubernetes, Docker, etc.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of stuff in Racket this year. Mostly personal
projects still under wraps.</p>

<p>OK, so my wife is calling me from upstairs now. Talking of which. She is great.
This blog post is dedicated to her. You are a strong, beautiful woman in the
face of all the hiccups you&#39;ve encountered through-out your life (including
me!). I love you.</p>
