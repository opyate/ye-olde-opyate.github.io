<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>This project failed miserably. Imagine a modern-day MPEG being decoded by a 25MHz 386 PC. Painfull. Well, that exactly what this project does for the modern computer (1.7GHz Pentium M).</p>

<p>Basically, I tried to emulate a video monitor by drawing web-based pixels on the screen. A pixel can be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a DIV tag</li>
<li>an IMG tag with a 1x1 GIF, and you&#39;d need 256 individual GIFs for this (or more)</li>
<li>a SPAN tag containing a character with HTML code 9606 which yields a little square like this: ▆</li>
</ul>

<p>The aim was to convert an MPEG movie into a Javascript array so that anyone with a Javascript web browser can watch a clip from anywhere. They wouldn&#39;t need any plugins.</p>

<p>Before I came to that part I did some tests on the WebTV. I tried to write random arrays to the WebTV to see how fast it can draw. Here are the findings for a tv with 7 548 pixels:</p>

<ul>
<li>DIV tags fails miserably in all tests. They are slow to alter.</li>
<li>GIFs are ok if you are going monochrome (jumping between two states). Check out <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/life/">life by Bram Cohen</a>.</li>
<li>The SPAN tag takes up to 30 seconds to draw a new frame. The performance becomes acceptable when the tv has about 60 pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, the tv can be seen <a href="/projects/webtv/webtv.html">here</a> happily drawing random pixels <em>[EDIT: this doesn&#39;t work on IE]</em>. Maybe the code can be optimised some more, or the Javascript engine for Firefox can use a bit of tweaking, in my case. Either way, on to the next project for now.</p>
