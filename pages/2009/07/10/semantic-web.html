<!-- modules/handlers/by-mime-type/image/_landingpage.rkt --><p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I&#39;m Juan and I&#39;m new to SW.</p>

<p>I eagerly jumped into the deep end of the SW pool and wanted to create a &quot;lists on the web&quot; program, but 30 minutes into the whole ordeal I realised that</p>

<ul>
<li>it&#39;s going to be a gross duplication of (possibly existing) data.</li>
<li>there&#39;s already a slew of tools I can utilise and improve.</li>
<li>I&#39;m very naive, and this Semantic Web thing is a beast ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s a post I left on the SW London Meetup.com group message board, to give you an idea of what I planned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to run an idea by you and would like some input as to its feasibility/usefulness.</p>

<p>In an attempt to learn Scala I want to do a fun SW project. My inspiration is the Cloud, Lisp&#39;s concept of lists, and my mate&#39;s listing of DVD titles on some crummy web site. I wanted to create a web site that isn&#39;t limited to just DVD titles. You could, for instance, have a list of favourite sci-fi novels (and have an ISBN plugin on top of it to add value) or have a list of friends (and have a FaceBook plugin... etc).</p>

<p>So, I guess, instead of having said plugins, you create RDF for your data:</p>

<pre>
my book has the identifier #isbn
with:
        subject = my book
        predicate = has the identifier
        object = some ISBN number
</pre>

<p>The upper ontology can be &quot;everything&quot; (i.e. the root of all your lists), then you can start breaking it down: people (and in turn family and friends), books (and in turn novels, novellas, prose) etc.</p>

<p>This data, and the meta data that describes it can now obviously be used by other services: Amazon can send you recommendations based on your books list. Some chef can send you recipes based on your favourite recipes list. Etc.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s all hosted in the cloud, or on your personal site, or on a site I&#39;m going to create for this purpose (domain already purchased: listabl.es). I hope to develop a re-usable piece of free Open Source software which anybody can host anywhere, then the various instances can &quot;talk&quot; and/or provide a useful API to the outside world.</p>

<p>The main pull for this idea in a social sense is that people like to make lists of their favourite things and share it.</p>

<p>This message is by no means complete, but I&#39;d like to discuss the idea further at the next meetup.</p>

<p>Juan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the initial github commit: <a href="http://listabl.es">listabl.es</a> </p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve created this github project, I&#39;ve started researching this weird and wonderful subject and came across things like FOAF, SKOS, etc. Presumably there&#39;s a namespace somewhere in there which can be re-used to link individuals with their &quot;lists of things&quot;.</p>

<p>Said &quot;things&quot; also shouldn&#39;t need to be duplicated if they exist already. E.g. one of my favourite authors is already defined here: <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Greg_Egan">Greg Egan on dbpedia.org</a> and surely my FOAF profile can somehow define a &quot;list of my favourite authors&quot; which in turn points to this resource.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, as you can see I&#39;m keen to learn and keen to invest my time in SW. I&#39;m very eager to work on something worthwhile, so please let me know where I can direct my attention to - perhaps an Open Source project? I&#39;m a coder - not an editor/writer, but if you need me on documentation duty, I&#39;ll gladly oblige.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and please leave a comment below, or <a href="mailto:%6F%70%79%61%74%65%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">contact me</a>.</p>
