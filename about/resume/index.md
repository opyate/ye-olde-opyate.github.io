# Juan M Uys

## Introduction

I'm a [London-based](http://pits-to-palace.tumblr.com/) South African who have been doing tech work since 2002. Most information about said activity can be found on my [personal website](http://opyate.com), but my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/juanuys) could very well be more up to date. I'm not open to relocation, but I'm very keen on remote working.

## [pollarize.me](http://app.pollarize.me)

Pollarize is a decision making platform that makes it quicker and easier for you to query your friends across multiple social networks and gather their responses into one concise answer. I co-founded pollarize at Startup Weekend London, March 2012, which we won. Shortly after, we were accepted into Wayra UK, whom gave us enough money to work on releasing pollarize on iOS and web in December 2012. Sadly, we have since run out of cash and have failed to secure more funding.

## [Net-A-Porter.com](http://www.net-a-porter.com/)

I have been working at Net-A-Porter.com for 7 years, and have done everything from implementing our first shared payment service, our first API, our first translations system, and I've also won a hack day with an iOS app. I've also led teams on occasion, and have made many friends during my time there.

## [Finance Leads Online](http://www.financeleadsonline.co.uk) / [BeatThatQuote](http://www.beatthatquote.com) 

FLO was the UK's fastest growing start-up in 2005 and won the HSBC regional award for best start-up in the London region. The company’s core business is generating and selling financial leads. As employee #5 (and the second techie!) I was resposible for implementing backends in Java, and customer self-service front-ends in RoR. BeatThatQuote &mdash; the brand &mdash; has since been acquired by Google.
