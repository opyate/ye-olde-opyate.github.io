## Introduction

I'm a [London-based](http://pits-to-palace.tumblr.com/) South African who has been doing tech work since 2002. Most information about said activity can be found on my [personal website](http://opyate.com), but my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/juanuys). I'm also very keen on remote working.

## [pollarize.me](http://app.pollarize.me)

Pollarize is a decision making platform that makes it quicker and easier for you to query your friends across multiple social networks and gather their responses into one concise answer. I co-founded pollarize at Startup Weekend London, March 2012, which we won. Shortly after, we were accepted into Wayra UK, whom gave us enough money to work on releasing pollarize on iOS and web in December 2012. Sadly, we have since run out of cash and have failed to secure more funding.

## [Net-A-Porter.com](http://www.net-a-porter.com/)

I have been working at Net-A-Porter.com for 7 years, and have done everything from implementing our first shared payment service, our first API, our first translations system, and I've also won a hack day with an iOS app. I've also led teams on occasion, and have made many friends during my time there.

## [BeatThatQuote.com](http://www.beatthatquote.com) 


[BeatThatQuote.com](http://www.beatthatquote.com/) (also trading as [Finance Leads Online](http://financeleadsonline.co.uk)) was the UK's fastest growing start-up in 2005 and won the HSBC regional award for best start-up in the London region. The company’s core business is generating and selling financial leads. As employee #5 (and the second techie!) I was resposible for implementing backends in Java, and customer self-service front-ends in RoR. BeatThatQuote has since been acquired by Google.

## Ye olden days

A large part of my career is too long ago to be technically relevant, so the takeaway for me is the experience, soft skills, and architectural knowledge.

## Extracurricular

* I do some speaking on APIs at [The Mobile Academy](http://themobileacademy.org.uk/whos-who/juan-uys/)
* You'll sometimes see me at the Scala, Ruby and various other meetup groups.

## Learning

I'm not a big fan of dust, rust and cobwebs of the mind. Here goes:

[Diploma in Scientific Computing](http://issc.uj.ac.za/issc/scschool.html), [electronic engineering drop-out](http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/engineering/departments/eeesci/Pages/default.aspx) (long story!), Sun Certified Java Programmer, [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), [Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis), [Web Intelligence and Big Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata), [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271) and I'm also a qualified advanced scuba diver.

## Doodling

I've recently taken up doodling, and like most people who dive into a new hobby, you initially think you're quite good (Dunning–Kruger!) and that's when you get picture book ideas and comic book ideas and think you can publish something one day. I'm now past that stage and think I suck quite a bit, but it's fun nonetheless and it might cheer someone up to see them.
